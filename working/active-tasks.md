### Send to AI Integration + OAuth Coordination
**Approach:** Ship chat improvements, coordinate Trevor's work, document everything

### Feature 1: Send to AI Integration - SHIPPED ✅

## 📊 Session Summary (2026-01-05 - Continued)

### Runtime-First Verification Session
**Approach:** Fix blockers one by one with runtime verification after each fix.

### Blocker 1: Auth Enforcement - FIXED ✅
- **Problem:** Unauthenticated users could access dashboard (saw hardcoded "Brent CEO")
- **Root Cause:** middleware.ts allowed demo mode bypass on protected routes
- **Fix:** Removed '/' from PUBLIC_ROUTES, cleared DEMO_ALLOWED arrays
- **Verified:** Unauthenticated requests now redirect to /login
- **Commit:** `a40e9c4`

### Blocker 2: Invitation Flow - FIXED ✅
- **Problem:** Couldn't create test users - no auth + app user linkage
- **Sub-issues Fixed:**
  1. Added `/api/v1/settings/invitations/` to PUBLIC_ROUTES (commit `1128881`)
  2. Created `createServiceRoleClient()` to bypass RLS for invitation lookup (commit `92e8fff`)
  3. Updated POST to use service role for all DB operations (commit `9c1a55d`)
  4. Switched from `signUp()` to `admin.createUser()` for auto-email-confirm (commit `401bc66`)
- **Test Credentials Created:**
  - Email: `e2e.test2@gmail.com`
  - Password: `TestPassword123!`
  - Role: admin
- **Verified:** Full login → dashboard with real user profile "E2E Tester"

### Blocker 3: @supabase/ssr Auth Hang - FIXED ✅
- **Problem:** Profile showed "Brent CEO" (hardcoded fallback) instead of "E2E Tester"
- **Symptoms:** Auth timeout after 5000ms, useAuth hook never completing
- **Root Cause:** `@supabase/ssr` client's `getSession()` AND `setSession()` methods hang indefinitely
  - Hangs occur BEFORE any network request (internal client state issue)
  - Both methods affected - not version-specific
  - Direct REST API calls work perfectly (~200-300ms)
- **Fix:** Bypass ALL Supabase auth methods:
  1. `getSessionFromCookie()` - parse auth cookie directly (no Supabase calls)
  2. `fetchProfileDirect()` - call REST API with Authorization header
  - Commit `2b96351` attempted setSession fix (still hung)
  - Commit `5ccc45c` implemented complete REST API bypass (SUCCESS)
- **Verified:** Dashboard now shows "E2E Tester" with correct profile data

### Results
- Dashboard shows real user "E2E Tester" (not hardcoded "Brent CEO")
- 20 clients loading with real data
- All KPIs, charts, firehose populated
- Invitation flow works end-to-end
- Auth completes via direct REST API

**Commits This Session:** a40e9c4, 1128881, 92e8fff, 9c1a55d, 401bc66, 2b96351, 5ccc45c

**Critical Issue Fixed:** 401 "No session" errors across all authenticated API endpoints
- **Root Cause:** Missing `credentials: 'include'` in fetch() calls
- **Impact:** Client list, dashboard, tickets, settings, knowledge base, automations all failing to load data
- **Fix:** Added credentials parameter to 10+ locations across stores and hooks
- **Result:** Overall project completion jumped from 92% to 95%

**Documentation Updated:**
- RUNBOOK.md - Production URLs updated to Agro Bros Vercel project
- CLAUDE.md - Complete project status, deployment info, feature matrix, testing checklist
- features/INDEX.md - Validation history and completion metrics

## ✅ Production Status (Verified 2026-01-05)

### Mock Mode: OFF
