**Branch:** `security-hardening` (separate worktree at `../audienceos-security-hardening`)
**Status:** Phase 1 of CTO-approved 3-week unified platform plan

### Completed This Session:
- ✅ `lib/crypto.ts` - Production guards, removed insecure fallback keys
- ✅ `lib/env.ts` - NEW centralized env validation module
- ✅ Gmail/Slack callback - Removed userId from all console logs
- ✅ `get-clients.ts` - Throws in production instead of mock data

### Remaining Week 1 Tasks:
- [ ] Apply `withPermission` to 9 OAuth routes missing RBAC
- [ ] Fix DEV MODE in: `get-alerts.ts`, `get-agency-stats.ts`, `get-recent-communications.ts`
- [ ] Remove 200+ console.log statements exposing sensitive data
- [ ] Add rate limiting to 34 unprotected auth routes

### Commit: `86f5c08`

## ✅ COMPLETED: Gmail/Slack Integration Fix (2026-01-20)

**Status:** DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

**Problem Identified:**
- UI showed "0 connected" despite database having integrations with `is_connected: TRUE`
- Root cause: UI read from diiiploy-gateway (single-tenant) instead of Supabase `integration` table
- Gateway returned `warning` status which UI didn't handle (only mapped `ok` → connected)

**Fix Applied:**
1. ✅ Rewrote `integrations-hub.tsx` to fetch from `/api/v1/integrations` (Supabase)
2. ✅ Updated `allIntegrations` builder to use `is_connected` from DB response
3. ✅ Removed gateway health dependency for integration status
4. ✅ Added human-readable last sync time formatting
5. ✅ Added type safety to API response

**Commits:**
- `9e87678` - "fix(integrations): read from Supabase instead of diiiploy-gateway"
- `579daf8` - "fix(integrations): add type safety to API response"

**Deployment:**
- Vercel Git connection was broken (repo transferred from `growthpigs/` to `agro-bros/`)
- Deployed via Vercel CLI: `npx vercel --prod`
- Production URL: https://v0-audience-os-command-center.vercel.app
- Build completed successfully at 09:24 UTC

**Verification:**
- ✅ Build passes (0 TypeScript errors)
- ✅ 103/103 integration tests pass
- ✅ Production site loads correctly
- ✅ Integration status reads from Supabase (shows "0 connected" for users without integrations)
- ✅ User-specific integration status (Brent CEO shows his status, Trevor will see his)

## ⚠️ Remaining Issue: Vercel Git Connection

**Problem:** Vercel project was connected to `growthpigs/audienceos-command-center` but repo was transferred to `agro-bros/audienceos-command-center`. Auto-deployments are broken.

**Current State:**
- Manual deployments via `npx vercel --prod` work
- Git webhooks don't trigger deployments automatically

**Options to Fix:**
1. Add `agro-bros` GitHub org to Vercel (requires GitHub OAuth)
2. Transfer repo back to `growthpigs` (requires GitHub admin access)
3. Continue using CLI deployments

## Next Priority: Test Trevor's Login

After Trevor logs in at https://v0-audience-os-command-center.vercel.app:
- His integrations should show correct connected/disconnected status
- The 5 integrations with `is_connected: TRUE` should appear as "Connected"
